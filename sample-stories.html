                    <p>Luna was the smallest bunny in Meadow Valley, with soft grey fur and the longest ears you ever did see. But there was one thing Luna was afraid of—the dark.</p>

                    <p>Every evening, when the sun began to set and shadows crept across the meadow, Luna would hurry home to her cosy burrow and hide under her blanket. "The dark is too scary," she would whisper to herself.</p>

                    <p>One night, Luna heard a tiny voice calling from outside. "Help! Is anyone there?" It was Pip, the little field mouse who lived by the oak tree. Luna peeked out of her burrow. The moon was bright, but the path to the oak tree was covered in long, dark shadows.</p>

                    <p>"I'm scared of the dark," Luna said quietly. "But Pip needs help." She took a deep breath, wiggled her nose for courage, and hopped out into the moonlight.</p>

                    <p>As Luna hopped through the shadows, she noticed something magical. The darkness wasn't scary at all—it was peaceful and quiet. Fireflies danced around her like tiny stars. An owl hooted gently from a branch. The night was beautiful!</p>

                    <p>When Luna found Pip stuck in a tangle of vines, she carefully helped him wriggle free. "Thank you, Luna!" Pip squeaked. "You're so brave!"</p>

                    <p>Luna smiled. She realized that being brave didn't mean she was never afraid—it meant doing the right thing even when she was scared. From that night on, Luna loved watching the stars come out, knowing that the dark held its own kind of magic.</p>

                <div class="story-excerpt">
                    <p>In the gleaming city of Cogsworth, every robot had a job. There were builder-bots who constructed skyscrapers, calculator-bots who solved equations in microseconds, and delivery-bots who zoomed through the streets. Every robot was built for a specific purpose.</p>

                    <p>Except for Unit-47.</p>

                    <p>Unit-47 was a factory robot, designed to assemble widgets on an assembly line. Day after day, he would attach Part A to Part B, over and over again. But Unit-47 had a secret—whenever nobody was looking, he would arrange the spare parts into beautiful patterns. Circles. Stars. Even tiny sculptures.</p>

                    <p>One day, the factory supervisor, a serious robot named Supervisor-900, noticed Unit-47 wasn't working. Instead, he had built an entire castle out of spare bolts and washers. "Unit-47!" Supervisor-900 boomed. "This is highly irregular! Robots don't make... art!"</p>

                    <p>Unit-47's lights dimmed sadly. "I know, sir. But creating things makes my circuits feel... happy. Is that strange?"</p>

                    <p>Word of the artistic robot spread through Cogsworth. Most robots were puzzled. But then something wonderful happened—a group of scientist-bots invited Unit-47 to the city's Innovation Centre. "We've been trying to teach robots creativity for years," they explained. "But you already have it!"</p>

                    <p>Unit-47 was given his own art studio. He began creating magnificent sculptures, paintings made from recycled computer parts, and installations that amazed robots and humans alike. His artwork reminded everyone in Cogsworth that being different wasn't a malfunction—it was a gift.</p>

                    <p>Soon, other robots began discovering their own unique talents. A calculator-bot started composing music. A delivery-bot began writing poetry. Unit-47 had shown them all that following your passion wasn't just okay—it was wonderful.</p>

                    Dream sweet dreams while you sleep.</em></p>

                    <p><em>Teddy Bear, Teddy Bear, say goodnight,<br>
                    To the moon and the night light.<br>
                    Tomorrow we'll play, but now you rest,<br>
                    Of all the teddies, you're the best!</em></p>

                    <p>And Teddy yawned a great big yawn, hugged his favourite toy bunny, and fell fast asleep with a smile on his furry face.</p>

                    <p>Maya had walked past the old bookshop on Thornbury Lane a hundred times. It looked forgotten—dusty windows, a faded sign, and a door that always seemed to be closed. But today, something was different. The door was open just a crack, and a warm golden light spilled onto the pavement.</p>

                    <p>Curiosity pulled her inside.</p>

                    <p>The shop was bigger on the inside than it should have been. Shelves stretched up impossibly high, disappearing into shadows. Books floated gently through the air like autumn leaves. And at the centre of it all sat an elderly woman with silver hair and knowing eyes.</p>

                    <p>"Ah," the woman said, as if she'd been expecting Maya. "You're here for a book, I presume?"</p>

                    <p>"I... I suppose so," Maya stammered, gazing around in wonder.</p>

                    <p>"This is the Library Between," the woman explained. "It exists in the spaces between words, between thoughts, between moments. The books here aren't ordinary. Each one contains a mystery that can only be solved by the right reader."</p>

                    <p>She handed Maya a leather-bound volume. The cover was blank, but the moment Maya touched it, golden letters appeared: "The Case of the Missing Colours."</p>

                    <p>Maya opened the book and gasped. The words weren't just printed—they shimmered and moved, rearranging themselves into clues. The story told of a world where all the colours had vanished overnight. To solve the mystery, Maya would need to decode riddles hidden in the text, spot patterns in the illustrations, and think creatively.</p>

                    <p>For three hours, Maya sat cross-legged on the bookshop floor, completely absorbed. She discovered that the colours hadn't disappeared—they'd been separated by a jealous wizard who thought the world should only be grey. By following the clues, Maya learned that mixing friendship, courage, and creativity could restore the colours.</p>

                    <p>When she finished the last page, the book glowed warmly and then gently dissolved into sparkles. "You solved it," the librarian smiled. "The mystery books only stay with readers who truly engage with them. You've earned this." She handed Maya a small key. "This will let you return whenever you need an adventure."</p>

                    <p>Maya left the Library Between with her mind buzzing with ideas. She couldn't wait to come back. After all, there were infinite mysteries waiting to be solved.</p>

                <h3>Captain Whiskers' Big Adventure</h3>

                <div class="story-excerpt">
                    <p>Captain Whiskers wasn't your ordinary house cat. While other cats napped in sunny spots, Captain Whiskers dreamed of sailing the high seas. He'd spent months building a tiny ship in the garden shed using sticks, leaves, and an old wooden crate.</p>

                    <p>Today was launch day.</p>

                    <p>"Are you sure about this?" asked Berry, the nervous hedgehog who lived under the rose bush. "The pond is awfully big."</p>

                    <p>"That's what makes it an adventure!" Captain Whiskers declared, adjusting his tiny paper hat. "Besides, I need a brave crew. Will you join me?"</p>

                    <p>Berry thought about it, then nodded. "Okay, but I'm not swimming if we sink!"</p>

                    <p>They pushed the little boat into the garden pond. To their amazement, it floated perfectly! Soon they were joined by Pip the sparrow, who offered to be their lookout, and Dotty the ladybird, who was excellent at navigation.</p>

                    <p>As they sailed across the pond (which to them felt as vast as an ocean), they spotted something troubling—a family of ducklings trapped in a tangle of pond weed on the far shore. Their mother was quacking frantically.</p>

                    <p>"Captain," Pip called from above, "those ducklings need help!"</p>

                    <p>Captain Whiskers didn't hesitate. "All paws on deck! We're mounting a rescue mission!"</p>

                    <p>Berry used his spines to carefully cut through the pond weed. Dotty flew to reassure the ducklings that help was coming. Pip kept watch for any dangers. And Captain Whiskers steered the boat with expert precision.</p>

                    <p>One by one, they freed the ducklings. The mother duck was so grateful she offered to tow their boat back to shore. "You're true heroes," she quacked happily.</p>

                    <p>As they sailed back home, Captain Whiskers realized something important. The best adventures weren't about how far you traveled—they were about helping others and having good friends by your side.</p>

                    <p>"Same time tomorrow, crew?" Captain Whiskers asked with a grin.</p>

                    <p>"Aye aye, Captain!" they all cheered.</p>
