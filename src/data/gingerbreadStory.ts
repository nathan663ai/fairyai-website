const gingerbreadContentEnGB = `In a cozy brick cottage at the edge of a bustling village, where **cinnamon** and **ginger** filled the morning air, an old woman tied on her apron with a cheerful hum.

"Today feels like a baking day," she said to her cat, who blinked lazily from the windowsill.

She stirred flour, butter, sugar, and **molasses** in her biggest wooden bowl. The dough was soft and sticky, warm with spice. Carefully, she rolled it out, cutting the perfect shape of a **gingerbread man**.

"Let's make you special," she said kindly, pressing **currants for eyes**, a **raisin for a smiling mouth**, and **three sugar pearls for buttons**. "There. Now into the oven you go."

She slid the tray in and shut the door. The heat shimmered and rose. The cat sniffed the air with interest.

But just as the timer ticked—

**POP!**

The oven door burst open, and out sprang the **Gingerbread Man**, golden-brown and grinning.

"Don't eat me!" he shouted, hopping to the floor. "**Run, run, as fast as you can! You can't catch me, I'm the Gingerbread Man!**"

And off he dashed—through the kitchen, past the startled cat, and out the door into the sunshine.

"Stop!" cried the old woman. "Come back!"

But the **Gingerbread Man** just laughed as his little cookie feet tapped along the garden path.
"**I ran from the woman, I'll run from you!
Run, run, as fast as you can!
You can't catch me, I'm the Gingerbread Man!**"

Soon he passed a **fat pink pig** in a muddy pen.

"Snort! You smell delicious!" oinked the pig, trotting after him.

But the Gingerbread Man just called,
"**I ran from the woman, I ran from her cat—
I'll run from a pig as quick as that!
Run, run, as fast as you can!
You can't catch me, I'm the Gingerbread Man!**"

He sprinted across the **village square**, past startled shopkeepers and baskets of apples, his little legs pumping fast.

Next came a **brown cow**, swaying her tail beside the fence.

"Moo! What a fine snack you'd make," she said, loping after him.

But he just shouted,
"**I ran from the woman, the cat, and the pig,
Running from you? That's not too big!
Run, run, as fast as you can!
You can't catch me, I'm the Gingerbread Man!**"

Dust rose behind him as the **pig and cow** joined the chase. Their hooves pounded the earth while children giggled and pointed.

Then a **tall horse** neighed from the meadow and gave chase.

"I'll catch you in no time!" he called, hooves thundering.

But the Gingerbread Man only sped up, darting through fields of golden wheat.

"**I ran from them all, you'll see I can—
You won't catch me, I'm the Gingerbread Man!**"

The animals huffed and puffed behind him. The old woman had given up, hands on her hips, muttering, "That'll teach me to bake something with legs."

The **Gingerbread Man** laughed as he raced through the woods, **leaves crunching beneath his feet**, birds scattering overhead.

But suddenly, he came to a **wide, rushing river**. The water swirled dark and fast, too deep to wade, too wide to leap.

"Oh crumbs," he said, pacing the riverbank.

Out stepped a sleek **fox**, his coat gleaming like polished copper.

"Why the long face, little cookie?" asked the fox, his voice smooth as melted butter.

"I need to cross this river," said the Gingerbread Man, glancing nervously at the current. "But I can't swim."

The fox's eyes twinkled. "Well, I can. Hop on my **tail**, and I'll carry you across."

Hesitating only a moment, the Gingerbread Man climbed aboard.

The fox stepped into the chilly water. **Ripples shimmered** as he paddled gently forward.

"Too splashy at the back," said the fox. "Hop up onto my **back**."

The Gingerbread Man climbed higher.

Soon the water lapped at the fox's neck. "Better get on my **head**," he said with a flick of his ears.

The Gingerbread Man obeyed.

But the water rose again.

"You'll get wet—best climb on my **nose**," whispered the fox.

As soon as the Gingerbread Man stepped onto the tip of the fox's nose—

**SNAP!**

With one quick toss of his head, the fox flipped the **Gingerbread Man** into the air and **gulped him down in a single bite**.

The river flowed on. Birds chirped. And the fox licked his lips.

"**Delicious.**"

Moments later, the **pig, cow, and horse** arrived, panting.

"Where is he?" gasped the pig.

The fox gave a small burp. "He got a little soggy," he said with a wink.

Back in the village, the old woman pulled another tray from the oven. She glanced at her cat and said, "This time, no legs."

**The End**`;
