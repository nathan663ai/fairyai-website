# FairyAI Website Redesign - Implementation Summary

## Status: IN PROGRESS

This document tracks the ongoing redesign to transform the site from a "spec sheet" to a focused "bedtime story app" marketing site.

## Completed So Far:

### New Pages Created:
✅ `/src/pages/HowItWorksPage.tsx` - Deep dive into product mechanics
✅ `/src/pages/SafetyPage.tsx` - Detailed safety & privacy information

### Still To Do:

1. **Create FeaturesPage.tsx** - Full feature breakdown with "Why FairyAI is different"
2. **Update Navigation.tsx** - Add routes for /how-it-works, /safety, /features
3. **Update Footer.tsx** - Add links to new pages
4. **Rewrite Hero.tsx** - Bedtime-focused, prominent download CTAs
5. **Simplify TwoLayers.tsx** - Convert to simple 3-step bedtime flow
6. **Condense FourPillars.tsx** - Make compact 4-card version with "Learn more" links
7. **Trim WhyDifferent.tsx** - Show only 3 items on homepage
8. **Create SafetyTeaser.tsx** - Short safety section for homepage linking to /safety
9. **Remove provider names** - Replace Suno/OpenAI mentions with generic terms
10. **Update HomePage.tsx** - Use new simplified components
11. **Update App.tsx** - Add new routes
12. **Build & Deploy** - Verify compilation and push to GitHub

## Key Design Principles:

- **Reframe**: "Bedtime story app" not "storytelling studio"
- **Simplify**: Move depth to subpages, keep homepage focused on download
- **Clarify**: No provider names, no tech jargon in marketing copy
- **Sell**: Make App Store/Google Play buttons prominent throughout

## Next Steps:

Run the continuation prompt to complete the remaining 10 items.
